## Discount Calculation Challenge

This C++ program calculates the discount for a purchase made at an e-market. It prompts the user to enter the price of a product and determines the discount to be applied based on the following rules:

- If the product cost is less than $50, no discount is applied.
- If the product cost is between $50 and $99.99 (inclusive), a 5% discount is applied.
- If the product cost is $100 or more, a 10% discount is applied.

The program then calculates the final price after the discount is applied and displays it along with the corresponding discount message.
